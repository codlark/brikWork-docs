# Introduction to brikWork
brikWork is a scripty card game maker that runs on the desktop. Text based layout files are combined with images and a data table to make cards that are exported as images or pdf files. 

## Features
 - CSS-like syntax familiar to any programmer
 - Easy to learn and powerful placement system that allows positions to be specified from any direction, and relative to other elements
 - Unitized numbers in pixels, inches, millimeters and more
 - Text with complex character support, preliminary testing shows Arabic and Devanagari work but I'd love to hear from people who actually use these alphabets
 - Text can be structured and contextually styled with html
 - Beginner friendly documentation that doesn't expect you to already know how things work
 - Layouts can specify other layouts as templates and use their settings and elements
 - A suite of "briks" that allow you to program your layouts with utilities like condition testing, substrings, and math


## How it works
Write a layout file like this one

```
example layout file
```
in your favorite editor -- there's a [plugin for VS Code](link to plugin) -- and run it in the brikWork app to see how it looks.

From there you can export your cards to individual images, a texture image for Table Top Simulator, or a PDF for print and play.
