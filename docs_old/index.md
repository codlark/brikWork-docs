# brikWork
brikWork is a scripty asset maker for board games. brikWork turns text based layout files into assets using Qt6.

brikWork is still in development and may contain bugs or have breaking changes in the future.

## brikWork layouts in brief

A layout file is a simple text file with an optional section of CSV data at the end that gets turned into a set of assets. Data from the CSV data is available to the layout to generate distinct assets. A layout is made of elements and those elements have properties that are set to values, including a programming utility called briks.

## brikWork layouts in longer

A layout file is a simple text file with sections for the layout properties and the elements
```
layout {
    width: 2.5in
    height: 3.5in
}
title {
    text: This is a [capitalize| [title] ] card!
    x: center
    y: 1in
}
image {
    source: [image]
    x: center
    y: center
}
```
Layout files can also have CSV formatted data
```
data {
image, title
images/smile.png, smiley face
}
```
For each row in the data a new asset will be generated, with the data from that row available as a brik with the name of the corresponding header.
Briks are the programing utility within values. Briks can be variables like `[title]`, or they can be functions like `[capitalize| ]` .

## Conventions used in this guide

* Any text meant to be text the user enters in a layout file will have `code styling` this includes numbers like `0` and text like `this`
* Briks are always presented with their square brackets, and functions with their first vertical bar like `[rowIndex]` and `[if| ]`
* Property values and function brik arguments are presented in ALL CAPS when being defined like `[lower| STRING ]`
